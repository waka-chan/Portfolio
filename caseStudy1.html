                    <h4><b>Role:</b> UX Designer & Researcher</h4>
                    <h4><b>Timeline:</b> 5 weeks</h4>
                    <h4><b>Status:</b> In Progress</h4>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
                    <h4>The Vendor Offer Portal (VOP) is an external facing enterprise tool that Target's vendors and vendor representatives use to input promotional informational that will show up in stores and online. The vendors are an important customer group because they submit 50% of all promotions. The outcome of this discovery will be used to inform and enhance the Vendor Offer Portal. </h4>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3><b>The Problem </b></h3>
                    <h4>Our engineering team released an MVP for a select number of pilot users based on a previous designers' prototype. I needed to understand two things as a new designer coming into this space:
                      <br></br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Are we building the right product for our vendors?</li>
                        <li>Are we building it right to serve their needs?</li>
                      </ul>
                    </h4>
                    <h4><em>How might we ensure we are building the right product to serve vendors' needs?</em></h4>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3><b>Research Focus</b></h3>
                    <h4>Based on the two questions I had in mind, I created a research plan that helped inform me on:
                      <br></br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Understanding the effectiveness and usefulness of VOP</li>
                        <li>Determining where our gaps are</li>
                        <li>Providing context to support enhancements</li>
                      </ul>
                    </h4>
                    <br></br>
                    <h3><b>Methodology</b></h3>
                    <h4>To support our efforts, we used three different methods for research. User interviews, group vendor interview, and usability testing</h4>

                    <h4><b>Who did we test?</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>7 vendors</li>
                      <li>Domestic, US-based vendors</li>

                      <li>What do users expect to happen after submitting their offer information?</li>
                    </ul></h4>
                    <h4>We spent the first half of the meeting conducting a user interview and the second half with the usability testing. For the interview, we touched on topics starting with basic questions around their role as the vendor and their background and experience working with Target. From there, we asked about their onboarding journey, and then went into the weeds with questions around their process and timeline when creating a promotional offer, and ended the interview portion with questions around specific offer information, like how they input their item data and the types of promotional offers they request.
                      <br></br>
                      We used specifc scenarios for the usability testing and had the users log into our prod-environment to complete specific promotional offer related tasks. We were specifically looking to understand what users expected to see when accessing our portal for the first time, how they would go about sharing their promotional offer details, and their expectations on what would happen after it was submitted.

                          <li>Users mentioned various ways to input item information; DPCIs with or without dashes, MIC#s, export functions for spreadsheets</li>
                          <li>Users did not feel confident when entering DPCIs manually or their Target contact email address due to a lack of a ‘check’ in the system that validated the information entered</li>
                          <li>Expected to be able to input discounts below 10%</li>
                          <li>Would be interested in a way to cross promote items with other vendors (but Target isn’t structured to allow this)</li>
                          <li>Would be nicer to have closer in lead times to allow for more flexibility</li>
                          <li>Would prefer a way to ‘copy’ offer information to reduce manual work</li>
                          <li>Would expect the ”end date” calendar to start with the chose “start date” instead of having to click ahead</li>
                          <li>Would expect an option for Store Only or Online only channels </li>
                          <li>Appreciates that there are warnings when things are skipped/left blank; they are good ‘guard rails’ </li>
                          <li>Would expect to be able to edit this form once it’s submitted </li>

                      We organized a large group of thirty domestic vendors and vendor reps and had them take an unmoderated pre-work survey to complete prior to our big bash. During the bash, we did a demo of the Vendor Portal as context for the $100 test. We then had everyone take the $100 test, which is based off the pre-work survey data, along with our findings from the usability tests and interviews. We then divided the group into five breakout rooms, where we discussed why people prioritized things the way they did. </h5>

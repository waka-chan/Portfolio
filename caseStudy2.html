        <p class="lead">Prior to designing the high fidelity prototypes, I conducted user testing on the mid-fidelity versions. One of the main takeaways from testing was that the banner did not have a clear Call to Action. This feedback was expected as the mid-fidelity was in grayscale and lacked photos. Another piece of feedback was the fact that because the organization is called Dogs Of A Good Society and had a paw print as the logo, users expectedly struggled with knowing that the org helped other types of animals as well.</p>

        <p class="lead">I created two high fidelity versions for AB User Testing. The main difference between the two versions is how we labeled the assistance form and the image we used. We noticed that all of the users preferred the B version, which had the assistance form labeled and an image of a veterinarian. In the carousel hero banner, we put in images of the President's dogs per her request, and also included images of the other types of animals they've helped, like cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs. This was to indicate the organization expanded beyond dogs as users indicated in the mid-fidelity testing that it was unclear.</p>
